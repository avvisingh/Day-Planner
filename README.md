### Description
This app is designed for employees who want to schedule their work-day and stay on top of their daily tasks. This app allows you to enter and save apps for each hour of your work day. The app displays each hour of your work day as a separate time block for which you can then enter event details. The time-blocks are all colour coded with your current hour showing up in green. Timeblocks for hours which have passed are displayed in a red background and timeblocks for future hours show with a blue background. Events are written in the text-area in the middle and then saved using the button to the right. Events which are saved will last the entirety of the day before being wiped at the end of the day (after 5pm).
